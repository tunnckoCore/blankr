## API

### [router()](index.js#L37)
A plugin that adds `.createRoute`, `.addRoute` and `.navigate` methods for any app based on [dush][], [base][] or [minibase][]. Notice that this plugin emit events - `route` if match, and `notFound` if not route found on defined routes.

**Params**

* `opts` **{Object}**: no options currently    
* `returns` **{Function}**: a plugin function which should be passed to `.use` method  

**Example**

```js
var dush = require('dush')
var router = require('dush-router')

var app = dush()
app.use(router())

console.log(app._routes) // => []
console.log(app.createRoute) // => function
console.log(app.addRoute) // => function
console.log(app.navigate) // => function
```

### [.addRoute](index.js#L85)
> Add/register an actual `route` with `handler` to the `app._routes` array. It uses `.createRoute` method to create an "route" object that is then pushed to `app._routes`.

_**Note:** If route handler returns something the `app.navigate` method
will return that exact value on route match._

**Params**

* `route` **{String}**: a simple route, express-like definition, e.g. `/user/:id`    
* `handler` **{Function}**: a function to be called when `route` match    
* `returns` **{Object}**: instance for chaining  

**Example**

```js
app.addRoute('/foobar', (context) => {
  console.log('state:', context.state) // => { hello: 'world' }
  console.log('params:', context.params) // => {}
  console.log('route:', context.route) // => '/foobar'
  console.log('pathname:', context.pathname) // => '/foobar'
})

app.navigate('/foobar', { hello: 'world' })

// or with params
app.addRoute('/user/:id', ({ state, params, route, pathname }) => {
  console.log('Hello ', state.username) // => 'Hello Charlike'
  console.log('Your ID is', params.id) // => 'Your ID is 123'

  console.log('route', route) // => '/user/:id'
  console.log('path', pathname) // => '/user/123'
})

app.navigate('/user/123', { username: 'Charlike' })
```

### [.createRoute](index.js#L142)
> Just create a `route` with `handler`, same as `.addRoute` method, but without adding it to `app._routes` array. This "route" object contains `.match`, `.regex`, `.route` and `.handler` properties. Where `.match` is a function that accepts single argument "pathname" to check against given `route`, `.handler` is the passed `handler` function, `.regex` is the generated regex for that `route` string and the `.route` is the given `route`. The `.match` function returns `null` if passed "pathname" string match to the given `route` but not params and `false` if passed "pathname" not match.

_**Note:** This method does not call the given route handler._

**Params**

* `route` **{String}**: a simple route, express-like definition, e.g. `/user/:id`    
* `handler` **{Function}**: a function to be called when `route` match    
* `returns` **{Object}**: a "route" object with few properties  

**Example**

```js
const r = app.createRoute('/user/:id', function abc (params) {
  console.log('hi user with id:', params.id)
})

console.log(r.match) // => function
console.log(r.handler) // => function
console.log(r.handler.name) // => 'abc'
console.log(r.route) // => '/user/:id'
console.log(r.regex) // => /^\/user\/(\w+)$/i

var params = r.match('/user/123')
console.log(params) // => { id: 123 }

// manually call the route handler
if (params !== false) {
  r.handler(params || {})
}

// not match, so returns `false`
params = r.match('/foobar')
console.log(params) // => false

var route = app.createRoute('/foobie', () => {})

// match, but no params, so return `null`
var res = route.match('/foobie')
console.log(res) // => null
```

### [.navigate](index.js#L199)
> Manually navigate to some route with url `pathname` and returns what the route handler returns. You can pass a custom `state` which will be passed to route handler's context as `context.state`. This method fires `notFound` event when not found match, and `route` when find a route.

**Params**

* `pathname` **{String}**: a url to navigate to    
* `state` **{any}**: optionally pass a "state", passed to route's handler    
* `returns` **{any}**: basically returns what the route handler return  

**Example**

```js
app.on('notFound', (context) => {
  console.log(`sorry ${context.pathname} page not exist`)
  console.log('this is incoming state:', context.state)
})
app.navigate('/foo/bar/qux', { aa: 11 })

app.addRoute('/hello/:place', (context) => {
  console.log('hi', context.params.place) // => 'hi world'
})
app.navigate('/hello/world')

// remove default "on route" handler
app.off('route')

// and define your custom one,
// to change route handler arguments
app.on('route', (handler, context) => {
  return handler(context.state, context.params)
})

// notice the handler signature, it's different than
// the default one seen in above `/hello/:place` route
app.addRoute('/user/:name', (state, params) => {
  var name = state.username || params.name

  console.log('name:', name) // => 'name: john' or 'name: charlike'

  return name
})

// it returns what the route handler return
var res = app.navigate('/user/john')
console.log(res) // => 'john', because there's no passed state

var ret = app.navigate('/user/hey', { username: 'charlike '})
console.log(ret) // => 'charlike'
```

## Notes

### About "on route"

You can customize everything. By default, we call the route handler with single "context" object
which contains `.route`, `.pathname`, `.params` and `.state` properties.

- `route` - the route of the handler, e.g. `/user/:id`
- `pathname` - the incoming url - 1st argument of `.navigate` method, e.g. `/user/charlike`
- `state` - optional "state" for the page - 2nd argument of `.navigate` method, e.g. `{ foo: 1 }`
- `params` - object, containing the params of the route, e.g. `{ id: 'charlike' }`

But instead of this you may want to pass more additional arguments to route handler or include 
only few of these above. To do this you can `off` the default `.on('route')` logic and provide
a new logic. The listener of `route` event will be passed with `(handler, context, el)` signature.
Where `handler` is the route handler function, `context` is the above context object, and `el` can be
the "previous" returned value of the handler call (it is useful for diffing).

In above API docs have existing example, but let's try it again.

```js
// remove the defafult
app.off('route')
```

Okey, let's say we want our route handlers to have `(params, actions)` signature.
We can get the first from the "context" object, but what about "actions". Let's think
 of the route handler as _"view"_, so we want to pass some actions to be done on some scenario.

> _**Tip:** This is the perfect place to plug in a virtual or real dom diffing algorithm! You
definitely should try to use [nanomorph][] here to see the magic! :)_ 

```js
const actions = {
  hi: (name) => alert('hi ' + name)
}

app.on('route', (handler, context) => {
  return handler(context.params, actions)
})
```

Now, let's define our simple view with [bel][], a simple DOM builder using tagged template strings.

```js
const html = require('bel')

app.addRoute('/hello/:name', (params, actions) => {
  return html`<div>
    <h1>Hello ${params.name}</h1>
    <button onclick=${() => actions.hi(params.name)}>Click me to alert you</button>
  </div>`
})
```

This view just outputs one heading and a button, which when is clicked will say "hi" to different persons,
based on the passed url, which in our case will be fired with `.navigate` method.

```js
const res = app.navigate('/hello/charlike')

console.log(res) // => DOM element
console.log(res.toString())
// =>
// <div>
//   <h1>Hello charlike</h1>
//   <button>Click me to alert you</button>
// </div>
```

And because `.navigate` method returns what is returned value from the matched route, we can
easy get the rendered page.

### About routing

By default we use _really simple_ approach for covering most common and simple cases. It is similar
to what we see in Express app's routing, where `:name` is a placeholder for some param.

But because everything is some simple, small and pluggable, you can create another plugin
that provide a different `.createRoute` method, for example using [path-match][]. There's 
only few things that you should follow and they can be seen in the source code, 
it is pretty small and easy to understand.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md][changelogmd-url] and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs

BG-Best.Info е форум в който съм редовен поради длъжността си. Като казах „поради длъжността си“ исках да кажа, че съм глобален модератор и няма как да не съм редовен. В форума съм вече от година и половина близо и вече взе да ми омръзва, но като по навик си влизам и си разглеждам темите с удоволствие. В него можете да вземете безплатни домейни .com/.net./.org/.info от superhosting.bg, като пишете в форума и от самите постове ви се натрупват точки чрез които можете да си поръчате по-горе посочените домейни. Също така търговията с точки е доста добра. Тоест ако не искате домейн, а форума ви харесва, може да се регистрирате просто за да ви правят хедъри, банери, аватари и други услуги срещу точки. Също така можете да релаксирате след дългият работен ден в субфорума „Лафче“, където някой път можете да срещнете и доста излишен спам. Това е от мен!
